# Diploid_Model_Two_Loci

Provides the code used for the simulations in ArxiveLink

Implementation of two individual based population dynamic simulations to investigate the dynamics of mutation load and prevalence of severe recessive disorders in a growing population under different mating schemes.

The "DiscreteModel" is works with the genetic forward simulation system SLiM (see https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM). The "ContinuousModel" is a implementation of the exact stochastic simulation Gillespie Algorithm. For more details on the two models see the supplemental material above.
